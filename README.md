# Information Visualization Project 1



## 1. Introduction

This project is called ***Gapminder***. It is the first project of my course ***Information Visualization***. This project dynamically shows the **Life Expectancy** & **Income** information for more than 150 countries around the world from **1900** to **2009**.

## 2. How to implement

① First, I used **Tableau** to analyze the Dataset. I made some conclusions and got some ideas to visualize the data.

② I used **D3.js** to manipulate the data, link several charts, draw the charts and make them interactive.

③ In this version, I used **HTML / CSS / JavaScript** to make a web page for showing the result.

## 3. Demo

**Notice:** use the link <http://jrui2015.github.io/D3-Labs> to see the dynamic Demo page.
